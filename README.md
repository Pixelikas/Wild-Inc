# Wild-Inc
Some wild business going on here! Wild Inc. is a competitive puzzle game where two players compete to see who can match 3 of the same device first, each character has a special ability that makes him unique.<br><br>
The game was developed using Game Maker, for the II GameJam (UNIVALI) 2017, in Brazil. So parts of it are in portuguese.<br><br>
